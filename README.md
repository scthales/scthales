My name is Thales, I'm a Postdoc researcher at Brown University under Professor Nora Ayanian. 
My research interests mainly encompass distributed control, consensus on multi-agent systems, and stochastic control of networks.
I'm also interested in learning how to represent high dimensional systems in a efficient form so we can effectively control them.
